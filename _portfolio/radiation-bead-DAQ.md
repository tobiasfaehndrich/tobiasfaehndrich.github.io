- We designed and tested a simple phototransistor circuit on a breadboard that
was to be used at SNOLAB for monitoring the speed of a radiation
calibration source.
- We then got the components and soldered it together
- We additionally wrote a Python script that created a Python DAQ system
with the RP SCPI commands and turned the RP into a sort of oscilloscope
where I could save data from the bead line passing by and plot out the peaks
of beads as well as the velocity over time.
