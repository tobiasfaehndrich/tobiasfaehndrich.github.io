- In unison with the vision of making everything streamlined and remote in the
lab, there had been discussions of making a PCB board and breakout boxes
for the LED control system. Up until our term, this was all chaotically laid
out on a breadboard circuit inside a little cardboard box.

- We got to work and made a MACH1 of the idea.

- Eventually after some iterations of the design process we landed on a small
board that would only have the components we really needed. We
additionally used a breakout box that we found in the lab to combine with
our PCB to achieve the results we wanted.
