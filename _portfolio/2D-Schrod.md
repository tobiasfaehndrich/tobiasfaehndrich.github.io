title: "The 2D Time Dependent Schrödinger Equation"
excerpt: "This PHYS 410 project delves into the computational exploration of quantum phenomena, focusing on solving the one-dimensional and two-dimensional time-dependent Schrödinger equations. In the one-dimensional case, the implementation involves discretization and the Crank-Nicolson method, with convergence testing and numerical experiments revealing the behavior of quantum particles interacting with barriers and wells. The two-dimensional extension utilizes the Alternating Direction Implicit (ADI) technique, offering a nuanced perspective on quantum dynamics in a broader spatial context. Numerical experiments, including scattering off various potentials and through double slits, illuminate complex phenomena such as self-interference. The project not only underscores the intricacies of quantum mechanics but also showcases the robustness of computational methods in simulating and visualizing these phenomena.
