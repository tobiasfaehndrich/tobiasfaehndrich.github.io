excerpt: 'We report on the coexistence of both normal and topological insulating phases in InAs/GaSb bilayer quantum well induced by the built-in electric field tuned optically and electrically. The emergence of topological and normal insulating phases is assessed based on the evolution of the charge carrier densities, the resistivity dependence of the gap via in-plane magnetic fields and the thermal activation of carriers. For the Hall bar device tuned optically, we observe the fingerprints associated with the presence of only the topological insulating phase. For another Hall bar processed identically but with an additional top gate, the coexistence of normal and topological insulating phases is found by electrical tuning. Our finding paves the way for utilizing a new electro-optical tuning scheme to manipulate InAs/GaSb bilayer quantum wells to obtain trivial-topological insulating interfaces in the bulk rather than at the physical edge of the device.'
